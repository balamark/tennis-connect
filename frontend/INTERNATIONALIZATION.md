# Multi-language Support (i18n) Implementation

## Overview

The Tennis Connect app now supports **multi-language functionality** with Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) as the default language, along with support for English, French, and Spanish. This implementation addresses [GitHub Issue #3](https://github.com/balamark/tennis-connect/issues/3).

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- **Default Language**: Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) (`zh-TW`)
- **Supported Languages**: 
  - 🇹🇼 Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
  - 🇺🇸 English
  - 🇫🇷 French  
  - 🇪🇸 Spanish
- **Language Persistence**: User's language choice is saved in localStorage
- **Language Switcher UI**: Dropdown component with flag icons
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile

### ✅ Components Internationalized
- **Header**: Navigation menu, auth buttons, user profile
- **Home Page**: Hero section, features, stats, call-to-action buttons
- **Demo Mode Banner**: Demo mode notifications
- **Language Switcher**: Self-contained language selection component
- **Players Near You**: Complete translation including:
  - All filter options (skill level, search radius, game styles, availability, gender preferences)
  - Search results and metadata (player counts, distance ranges)
  - Player cards (distance badges, location info, match status, action buttons)
  - Loading states and error messages
  - Tips section and help text
  - Expanded search notifications and fallback states
- **Play Bulletin Board**: Core translation including:
  - Main title and subtitle
  - Filter options (skill level, game type, search radius)
  - Game type translations (Singles, Doubles, Either)
  - Loading states and demo mode messages
  - Distance preferences and search controls

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
frontend/src/
├── i18n/
│   ├── index.js                 # i18n configuration
│   └── locales/
│       ├── zh-TW.json          # Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
│       ├── en.json             # English
│       ├── fr.json             # French
│       └── es.json             # Spanish
└── components/
    └── LanguageSwitcher.js     # Language selection component
```

### Libraries Used
- `react-i18next`: React integration for i18next
- `i18next`: Internationalization framework
- `i18next-browser-languagedetector`: Auto-detect user language
- `i18next-http-backend`: Load translations dynamically

### Configuration
The i18n system is configured with:
- **Fallback Language**: Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
- **Detection Order**: localStorage → browser language → HTML tag
- **Persistence**: Language choice saved in localStorage as `i18nextLng`

## Usage

### For Developers

#### Adding New Translations
1. Add translation keys to all locale files (`zh-TW.json`, `en.json`, `fr.json`, `es.json`)
2. Use the `useTranslation` hook in components:

```javascript
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('navigation.home')}</h1>
      <p>{t('home.welcome')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Translation Key Structure
```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "home": "首頁",
    "findPartner": "尋找夥伴"
  },
  "home": {
    "welcome": "歡迎來到 MatchPoint",
    "features": {
      "title": "探索所有功能"
    }
  }
}
```

### For Users

1. **Language Switcher**: Located in the header (both desktop and mobile)
2. **Language Selection**: Click the flag/language dropdown to choose your preferred language
3. **Persistence**: Your language choice is remembered across browser sessions

## Current Translation Coverage

### ✅ Fully Translated
- Header navigation and authentication
- Home page content (hero, features, stats)
- Language switcher interface
- Demo mode notifications
- **Players Near You page** - Complete translation with all filters, search results, player cards, and status messages
- **Play Bulletin Board** - Core functionality translated including filters, game types, and main interface

### 🚧 In Progress  
- **Play Bulletin Board** - Additional areas needing translation:
  - Bulletin creation forms
  - Response handling and user interactions
  - Status messages and action confirmations

### ⚠️ Partial Translation
- Login/Register forms (still contain some hardcoded English strings)
- Error messages and notifications in other components
- Other component pages (Court Finder, Events, Communities, Profile)

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Complete Component Coverage**: Translate Login, Register, and other components
2. **Error Message Localization**: Add i18n for all error states
3. **Date/Time Formatting**: Locale-specific date and time formats
4. **RTL Support**: Consider right-to-left languages if needed
5. **Additional Languages**: Easy to add more languages by creating new JSON files

### Adding New Languages
To add a new language (e.g., Japanese):
1. Create `frontend/src/i18n/locales/ja.json`
2. Add all translation keys with Japanese translations
3. Update `frontend/src/i18n/index.js` to include the new language
4. Add the language option to `LanguageSwitcher.js`

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Build compilation (no errors)
- ✅ Language switching functionality
- ✅ Persistence across browser sessions
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile and desktop

## Browser Support

The i18n implementation supports all modern browsers and maintains compatibility with the existing React application architecture.
